### 문제 설명

<p>FJ wants to take pictures of his N cows (2 <= N <= 1,000,000,000), which are standing in a line and conveniently numbered 1..N. Each photograph can capture a consecutive range of cows from the lineup, and FJ wants to make sure that each cow appears in at least one photo.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are K unfriendly pairs of cows (1 <= K <= 1000) that each refuse to be in the same photograph. Given the locations of these unfriendly pairs, please determine the minimum number of photos FJ needs to take.</p>

### 입력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and K.</li>
	<li>Lines 2..K+1: Line i+1 contains two integers, A_i and B_i, stating that the cows in positions A_i and B_i are unfriendly and therefore cannot be in the same photograph.</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: A single integer, specifying the minimum number of photos FJ needs to take.</li>
</ul>
